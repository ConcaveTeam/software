* Installation
- Install [[http://wiki.ros.org/][ROS]]
- =cd <your_catkin_ws>/src>=
- Clone this project: =git clone https://github.com/olinrobotics/gravl.git=
- Navigate back to the catkin works pace root: =cd ..=
- Install dependencies: =rosdep install -iry --from-paths src=
- Build the platform: =catkin_make=
- Done.
  Now you can run one of the modes in the section below.

* Modes of Operation

** Monocular Motion Tracking
- Command :: =roslaunch concaveteam trackmono.launch=
- View annotated image :: =rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view trackmono=
- View published point :: =rosrun rviz rviz=, hit =Add=,  select =PointStamped=, expand the triangle under the new PointStamped heading on the left, and select =/target=..
     You will need to zoom out, point the camera downwards, and increase the radius of the point to around 100 for an easy view.

This publishes an annotated image with moving objects circled in =/monotrack= as well as the most significant point in image coordinates called =target=.
